End-to-End Workflow of BenevoLen - From Dataset Creation to Deployment. This figure illustrates the comprehensive pipeline of BenevoLens, spanning dataset creation, model training, and deployment.
Dataset Preprocessing (1a): BenevoLenSet, a first-of-its-kind labeled dataset for benevolent sexism detection, was constructed from four distinct sources: workplace interactions, media discourse, political debates, and social narratives. A structured annotation framework (Cookbook approach) was applied to ensure consistent and high-quality labeling, enabling the dataset to capture nuanced expressions of benevolent sexism across diverse contexts.
Deep Learning Model Training & Validation (1b): The dataset was split into training and validation subsets, which were iteratively tested across multiple deep learning architectures. Various fine-tuned transformer-based models, including BERT, were evaluated to determine the most effective approach for detecting subtle biases. The final model selection was based on performance metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, and generalizability across independently classified datasets.
Deployment & Web-Based Accessibility (1c): The optimized model was deployed using cloud-based solutions, allowing for scalable and free web-based access. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to HR professionals, researchers, and policymakers, ensuring real-world applicability in detecting and mitigating benevolent sexism in professional and social environments.
